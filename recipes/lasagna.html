        <p><strong>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</strong></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h3>

        <h3>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h3>
        <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. <br>
            Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. <br>
