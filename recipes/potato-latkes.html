        <h3>How to Make Potato Latkes Step-By-Step</h3>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Potato Latkes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment.
                <br>shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl;
                <br>save any extra for another use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat.
                <br>Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties.
                <br>Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
